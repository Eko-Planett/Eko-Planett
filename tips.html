        <h3> 10 Tips on How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint! </h3>
        <h4> 1.Eat With the Seasons, and Eat Less Meat </h4>
        <p> Try and eat foods that are grown in the seasons you are in, for example, try and eat pumkins only in the fall! Try not to eat foods such as peaches in the winter, even though it may be hard, trust us, it'll give you more satisfaction when you eat it! </p>
        <p> Eating less meat helps the planet because taking care of animals produces methane. Methane is a gas that is even more damaging than gas produced by fossil fuels and damages the ozone, a protective laver around the Earth that protects the planet against dangerous radiations. Red meat (cows' meat) produces most of this, so if you really can't stop yourself, try eating less beef! </p>
        <h4> 2. Take Short Showers Instead of Long Baths </h4>
        <p> Baths waste loads of water which we could easily save by taking showers. Even though the pleasure is less, it really helps our planet! Try not to make your showers TOO long though, otherwise you might as well take baths! </p>
        <h4> 3. Unplug your devices </h4>
        <p> Electronics suck energy when they’re plugged in, even if they’re not actually being used. Anytime a cord is plugged into a socket, it’s drawing energy, so leave your electronics unplugged at all times unless you’re actually using them. </p>
        <h4> 4. Drive less </h4>
        <p> You can make a huge different to your carbon footprint by leaving the car at home and instead walking, biking, or even taking the bus. Traditional cars produce a huge percentage of the world’s air pollution, and the toxins omitted by vehicles are also very dangerous for human health. Instead, by riding your bike you’ll be getting a workout all while helping the environment. Plus, it requires much less energy to produce a bike than it does to manufacture a car. </p>
        <h4> 5. Buy From Charities </h4>

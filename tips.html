        <h3> 10 Tips on How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint! </h3>
        <h4> Eat With the Seasons, and Eat Less Meat </h4>
        <p> Try and eat foods that are grown in the seasons you are in, for example, try and eat pumkins only in the fall! Try not to eat foods such as peaches in the winter, even though it may be hard, trust us, it'll give you more satisfaction when you eat it! </p>
        <p> Eating less meat helps the planet because taking care of animals produces methane. Methane is a gas that is even more damaging than gas produced by fossil fuels and damages the ozone, a protective laver around the Earth that protects the planet against dangerous radiations. Red meat (cows' meat) produces most of this, so if you really can't stop yourself, try eating less beef! </p>

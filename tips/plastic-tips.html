      <p> Here are some tips on how to make your house moore eco-friendly! </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h4> 1. Use Reusable Bags </h4>
      <p> Now, plastic bags are a serious threat- and we know this. However, we use so many single-use bags that we could stuff 2 of the White House with all the plastic bags that we use each year. This can be very easily avoided, by using bags that are not plastic. These offer many benefits, such as being more resistant, lasting longer, and don't cost you 5 cents each time you need to use them. </p>
      <h4> 2. Reusable Water Bottles </h4>
      <p> Stopping plastic usage is not so easy in some aspects, but changing to using reusable water bottles is one of the easiest changes you can do to help the enviroment. This has also many benefits, since metal bottles are much more resistant than plastic ones, also, non-plastic water bottles have much better designs than single use plastic bottles. This choice is benefitting for the enviroment , easy to do, and it will also benefit you. Some plastic bottles have some microscopic pieces of plastic in them, and by drinking water from the latter, we consume those microplastics. This, of course, doesn't happen with reusable, metal bottles. </p>
      <h4> 3. Say No to Straws </h4>
      <p> Did you know that over 500 million straws get used and thrown away each day? Straws are amongst the worst kinds of single-use plastic. They are easily consumable, and make animals choke. We can stop this by not using straws anymore. So sip your drink! Trust us, you will feel better. As a reward for not using straws, think of a happy turtle thanking you for saving its life. </p>
      <h4> 4. Avoid Microplastics </h4>
      <p> Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic (about the size of a sesame seed) that can be found in many cosmetic and toiletry items including face wash and toothpaste. These small pieces of plastic get flushed down sinks and drains and end up in our water systems including oceans, lakes an rivers. Unfortunately, plastic does not break down or dissolve in water so it continues to pose a threat for marine life and birds, making them choke, which can then have a great chain effect including us in it. Studies are still being done to see what sort of long-term affects this might have on animal and human life, but what we currently know is that just not using it is a much better decision.. </p>
      <h4> 5. Pack In or Pack Out Lunches </h4>
      <p> If you normally eat out for lunch, try packing your own lunch in a reusable container instead. Not only will you save some money, but you'll also avoid any single use plastics that your food might otherwise come in. In addition, if you do go out to eat for lunch, consider bringing your own Tupperware to the restaurant for leftovers instead of using the disposable to-go containers. </p>
      <h4> 6. Shop in Bulk Bins </h4>
      <p> Many items such as nuts, fruits and beans are available in bulk bins which can be found at most grocery stores. By purchasing items from the bulk bins, you can avoid the single-use plastic that most items are wrapped in, and you can get the amount you need to avoid wasting food. Keep in mind that purchasing from bulk bins is not the same as buying in bulk because even though buying in bulk can be a better option to reduce excessive packaging, you'll find that you end up with more food than you need and it can be wasteful. </p>
      <h4> 7. Buy Loose and Fresh </h4>
      <p> To go along with the tip above, buying fruits and veggies loose versus packaged will help lower your use of plastic. In addition, the small plastic bags that are available at grocery stores to put your food in is not at all necessary so if you're looking to use less plastic, you should skip them entirely. If you still prefer to bag your loose fruits and veggies, consider buying reusable produce bags to bring to the store with you. You can even find some that might increase the shelf life of certain foods! </p>
      <h4> 8. Reusable at Parties </h4>
      <p> Parties and get-togethers are one of the most common places to see waste from disposable plastic plates and silverware to one-time use decorations. Next time you host, consider using reusable and washable plates, cups and silverware instead of disposable. Not only will you reduce your waste, but it'll help make your party feel more personal and homey. In addition, if you do want to buy decorations, consider buying supplies that can be reused for years such as a universal "happy birthday" banner or cake topper.  </p>
      <h4> 9. Make Your Own Cleaners </h4>
      <p> In the U.S. we generate 1.6 million tons of harmful household chemicals with a normal house having as much as 300 pounds of household dabgerous waste. By making your own cleaner in a reusable bottle, you'll avoid the single use plastic bottles that most cleaners come in and you'll greatly decrease harmful chemicals in your home. </p>
      <h4> 10. Fix It </h4>
      <p> It's often easier for us to throw away common items when they break, but did you know you can get many of them fixed for free? In fact, every month Dakota County offers a free fix-it clinic where you can get expert help fixing common household items. Many residents have visited these clinics to fix old vacuum cleaners, broken fans, ripped clothing and so much more. To find an upcoming clinic near you, visit the Dakota County website and search "fix it." </p>

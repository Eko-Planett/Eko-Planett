      <h3> 10 Tips on How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint! </h3>
      <p> Here are some tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint! </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="section">
      <h3> 1. Eat With the Seasons, and Eat Less Meat </h3>
      <p> Try and eat foods that are grown in the seasons you are in, for example, try and eat pumkins only in the autumn! Try not to eat foods such as peaches in the winter, even though it may be hard. </p>
      <p> Eating less meat helps the planet because taking care of animals produces methane. Methane is a gas that is even more damaging than gas produced by burning fossil fuels and damages the ozone layer, which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Cows' meat produces most of this, so try eating less beef. </p>

      <h4> 2. Take Short Showers Instead of Long Baths </h4>
      <p> Baths waste loads of water which we could easily save by taking showers. Try not to make your showers TOO long though, otherwise you might as well take a bath. </p>

      <h4> 3. Drive less </h4>
      <p> You can make a huge different to your carbon footprint by leaving the car at home and instead walking, biking, or even taking the bus. Traditional cars produce a huge percentage of the world’s air pollution, and the toxins omitted by vehicles are also very dangerous for human health. Instead, by riding your bike you’ll be getting a workout all while helping the environment. Plus, it requires much less energy to produce a bike than it does to manufacture a car. </p>
      <p> Or, you could save up for an electric car! These help the environment a lot, as long as you make sure your energy supplier is renewable. Otherwise, you would still be polluting because the electricity might be produced by fossil fuels. </p>

      <h4> 4. Buy From Charities </h4>
      <p> Unless you’re already a mindful shopper, the clothes in your wardrobe have likely crossed thousands of miles before ending up in your possession. So next time you need a new outfit, head to a second-hand shop, which is better for the environment. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h4> 5. Fly Less </h4>
      <p> Fly often? Taking one fewer long round-trip flight could shrink your personal carbon footprint significantly. Think about it this way: If you use public transport often, and fly home to visit family just occasionally, your carbon footprint might still be relatively sustainable, but if you drive and fly a lot, your emissions will be higher. </p>

      <h4> 6. Put the Right things in the Right Bin </h4>
      <p> Americans generate about roughly 258 million tons of garbage a year, 169 million tons of which ends up in landfills and incinerators, according to a 2014 report from the E.P.A. That year, Americans recycled and composted 89 million tons of municipal solid waste — this saved the same amount of energy as used by 25 million homes. But much of the waste that can be recycled still ends up in landfills. </p>

      <h4> 7. Filter Your Own Water </h4>
      <p> If you still buy packaged bottled water, you're doing the planet a major disservice. Beyond the environmental toll of the plastic waste from each 16 ounce serving, consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it in the supermarket. If you live in most western countries, tap water is perfectly suitable for consumption, especially if you use a filtration pitcher. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h4> 8. Plant a Tree </h4>
      <p> This classic way to give back to the environment is one of the most efficient ways you can cut your carbon footprint. Trees provide shade and oxygen while consuming carbon dioxide. According to the Urban Forestry Network, a single young tree absorbs 13 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. That amount will climb up to 48 pounds annually as trees mature. Just one 10-year-old tree releases enough oxygen into the air to support two human beings. </p>

      <h4> 9. Choose a Laptop Over a Desktop </h4>
      <p> Laptops, unlike desktop computers, are designed to be energy-efficient, because battery life is a major factor to laptop design. According to Energy Star, a laptop can be up to 80% more energy-efficient than a desktop. Energy-efficient LCD screens, hard drives, processors and adaptors all factor into making makes laptops much better tools for the planet. </p>

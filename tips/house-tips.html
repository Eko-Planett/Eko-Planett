      <h4> 1. Get Serious About Water </h4>
      <p> When we consider the word ‘sustainability’ we often consider that it only relates to energy consumption. But being truly eco-friendly means taking a holistic approach, so you’ll need to get serious about saving water. Firstly, take the time to fix any leaks. Even if there are no leaks there are plenty of lifestyle changes you can make to save water. For example, you should ensure that you don’t run the tap when you brush your teeth or shave. It’s also a good idea to install a low-flow shower-head – these have been shown to save up to 160,000 liters of water for a family of four. </p>
      <h4> 2. Energy Efficient Light Bulbs </h3>
      <p> Using LED bulbs can save a WHOLE lot of energy. In fact, they save up to 96.6% compared to the average incandesent light bulb! </p>
      <h4> 3. Install Solar Panels </h3>
      <p> Solar panels are an essential feature for any eco home. Providing you with completely clean electricity they can sometimes even make enough energy to allow you to sell some back to the grid. Solar panels are certainly a long-term investment and it has been suggested that it will take around 20 years for you to break even depending on where you live. But remember this is not just a monetary investment – it’s an opportunity to be eco-friendly. </h3>
      <h4> 4. Use Eco Friendly Cleaning Products </h3>
      <p> Using harmful chemicals to clean is very bad for the environment. When you wash them away you are simply putting them into the water supply. That means the water will need more purification before it is safe to use again. But the good news is that in the majority of cases you really don’t need to use them. For most day-to-day cleaning tasks, natural products like vinegar, citric acid from citrus fruits and bicarbonate of soda can be used in place of caustic chemicals to great effect. </p>
      <h4> 5. Insulate </h3>
      <p> One of the smartest ways to improve your home’s eco-friendliness is to ensure that you use as little energy as possible. Investing in insulation is a great way to do this. Good insulation helps hold in the heat, meaning you don’t need to burn energy reheating the home all of the time. There are plenty of places that can and should be insulated including within the walls and in the roof. It can also be smart to consider double glazing any windows that don’t already have it. Also, consider covering any exposed hardwood floors in southwest area rugs. Area rugs are a cost-effective and stylish way to help insulate your home and prevent air from slipping out through the cracks in your floors. </p>
      <h4> 6. Create Your Own Compost </h3>
      <p> Don’t waste your kitchen scraps and leftover food – turn them into compost. You would be surprised how much of the food that you currently throw away can be recycled and turned into compost. Simply place a compost bin in your garden and fill it with any food waste. </p>
      <h4> 7. Buy Recycled </h3>
      <p> It’s a good idea to try to buy recycled products whenever you can. This can include everything from toilet tissue to kitchen roll. Whenever you notice that there is a recycled option available to buy, it’s worth purchasing it. Not only can you buy recycled paper, but you can also buy recycled technology like mobiles, gaming consoles, even recondition stairlifts from thyssenkrupp. </p>
      <p> Some trousers are even made from recycled plastic bottles! </p>
